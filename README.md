## Description
This project is part of our Data Structures course for the midterms. The project requires us to implement the huffman coding method in compressing the represented bits of a given string of characters. The project also requires that the program can decode a huffman code to its equivalent text.

## Project Structure
- `src` contains the source code for the sorting algorithms.
- `Character Set` stores the text file to be utilized to create the huffman code

## Usage
To run the application simple go to the app package and run the HuffmanCodecApp.java class

## Task Checklist
- [x] `HuffmanCodecApp.java` : Executable class
- [x] `BinaryEncoder.java` : Class that handles the conversion of string to it's binary representation
- [x] `CharacterFrequencyCounter.java` : Class that handles the obtaning of character sets and frequencies
- [x] `FileReaderUtility.java` : Class that handles the reading of a file 
- [x] `HuffmanCodec.java` : Class that handles all huffman related processes
- [x] `TreeNode.java` : Reference class that is responsible for the huffman tree
- [x] `GUI.java` : Frame of the GUI
- [x] `MainPanel.java` : Main panel of the GUI
- [x] `SidePanel.java` : Side Panel of the GUI
- [x] `GraphicEditor.java` : GUI editor
